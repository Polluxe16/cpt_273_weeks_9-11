This is Aiden Robbins' Voice Assistant project. It contains various features, and I will be walking through them here.

This repository contains two files; my final assignment and a rough draft that was included to see part of the process for this assignment. The focus of the repository is on the VoiceAssistantMainFinal file.

In order to run this file, there are a few dependencies that you will need to install. They are:

SpeechRecognition,
datetime,
pyjokes,
webbrowser,
pyautogui

In order to install each of these, ensure that you have Python installed on your computer as well as pip, and run the following command in the terminal:

pip install SpeechRecognition datetime pyjokes webbrowser pyautogui

or simply run the command a separate time for each dependency.

Once you have these installed, download the file. To run the program, ensure that it has the .py file extension, then navigate to the directory it is in in the command prompt or your python editor and run this command:

python VoiceAssistantMainFinal.py

And the program should start.


Now once the program starts, as long as you have a microphone connected, it shouls start to listen for your input. There are various keywords that will activate certain functions. These keywords and their functions are listed here:

Time: Will tell you the current time        
Joke: Will tell you a joke        
Cow: Will Moo at you        
Open Browser: Will open your web browser to a really cool YouTube video        
Move: Will move your mouse to the top left corner of your screen        
Find: Will print the coordinates of your mouse's location on the screen        
Exit: Will close the program      

And that is all for the project!
